WP Accessibility provides fixes for common accessibility issues in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plug-in helps with a variety of common accessibility problems in WordPress themes. While most accessibility issues can't be addressed without directly changing your theme, WP Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with a minimum amount of setup or expert knowledge.

All features can be disabled according to your theme's needs. For advanced users, all of the functions based on modifying stylesheets can be customized using your own custom styles by placing the appropriate stylesheet in your theme directory.

= Accessibility Features added by WP Accessibility: =

* Enable skip links with WebKit support by adding JavaScript support to move keyboard focus.
* Add skip links with user-defined targets. (Customizable targets and appearance.)
* Add language and text direction attributes to your HTML attribute
* Add an outline to the keyboard focus state for focusable elements. 
* Add a toolbar toggling between high contrast, large print, and desaturated (grayscale) views of your theme.
* Add a long description to images. Use the image's "Description" field to add long descriptions.

= Accessibility Issues fixed by WP Accessibility: =

* Remove the target attribute from links.
* Force a search page error when a search is made with an empty text string. (If your theme has a search.php template.)
* Remove tabindex from elements that are focusable.
* Strip title attributes from images inserted into content. 
* Remove redundant title attributes from page lists, category lists, and archive menus. 
* Add post titles to standard "read more" links.
* Address some accessibility issues in the WordPress admin styles

= Accessibility Tools built into WP Accessibility: =

* Show the color contrast between two provided hexadecimal color values.
* Enable diagnostic CSS to show CSS-detectable problems in visual editor or on front-end of site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WP Accessibility is inserting some information via javascript. Is this really accessible? =

Yes. It does require that the user is operating a device that has javascript support, but that encompasses the vast majority of devices and browsers today, including screen readers.

= I installed WP Accessibility and ran some tests, but I'm still getting errors WP Accessibility is supposed to correct. =

Even if WP Accessibility is running correctly, not all accessibility testing tools will be aware of the fixes. Here's a resource for more information: [Mother Effing Tool Confuser](http://mothereffingtoolconfuser.com/).
